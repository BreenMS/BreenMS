ðŸ‘‹ Hi there

Our team has three main research foci: 
1) We use multi-omic profiling to study the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying rare neurodevelopmental disorders. 

2) We also design specific RNA editing therapuetics to treat them. 

3) We leverage large-scale transcriptomics to learn something new about the fundamentals of RNA editing in human brain development and disease.
